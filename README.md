# Anushilon-Virtual-Science-Lab

ANUSILON is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the Internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being scarce or costly.

### Features

- This system brings a solution that can help to overcome such obstacles of practicing science decently by:

1. Content aligned to NCTB Board Syllabus ( Bangla Version).
2. Physics, Chemistry, Biology Lab Experiments from SSC and HSC.
3. Interactive simulations, animations, theory, and lab videos.
4. Learning from simulations and helping to calculate their experiment results through an automated system.
5. Teachers create lab rooms and can give lab experiment assignments. Students enroll in that Lab Room and submit that experiment. Also, generate results accuracy with graph view.
6. The ability to perform, record and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime, and individualized practice in all areas of experimentation.
7. Helping them to understand the opportunities & scopes of what they can do more with their experiments.
